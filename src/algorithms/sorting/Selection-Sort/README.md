# :zap: Selection Sort :zap:
It is a simple sorting algorithm, that takes the first value of an array and set it as minimum. It iterates over the array searching for a minimum and swap with the old minimum value. After iterates once set the minimum value at first place and continue with the second value of the array until it is ordered.

### Time complexity 

The selection sort employs two loops, one loop for each value of the array, so the time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>). 
In any case, the array is passed one time for each value so the best-case time complexity also is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
