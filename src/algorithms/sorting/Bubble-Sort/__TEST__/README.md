# :zap: Bubble Sort :zap:
It is a simple sorting algorithm, that compares each pair of consecutive elements and if they are not sorted, it swap them. It iterate over the whole array until it has no elements to swap.

### Time complexity 

The bubble sort employs two loops. The inner loop performs O(n) comparisons. In the worst case, the outer loops runs O(n) times. So in the worst case, the time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>). 
In the best case, the array is passed one time so the best-case time complexity is O(n).
